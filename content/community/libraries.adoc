== Clojure Contrib

Clojure Contrib is a collection of libraries managed with the same Contributor Agreement, license, and development workflow as Clojure itself. Code in Clojure Contrib can be considered for inclusion in newer versions of Clojure.

Clojure Contrib library code is hosted on https://github.com/clojure[Github]. Design and issue tracking are via http://dev.clojure.org/display/doc/Clojure+Contrib[Confluence] and JIRA.

Prior to Clojure 1.3, Contrib was packaged as a single monolithic JAR. If you are migrating from a pre-1.3 version of Clojure, please see http://dev.clojure.org/display/community/Where+Did+Clojure.Contrib+Go[this page] for migration help regarding old contrib libraries.

== Leiningen

The vast majority of Clojure developers use https://github.com/technomancy/leiningen[Leiningen] to create and manage Clojure projects.

== IDEs and Developer Tools

Community volunteers maintain http://dev.clojure.org/display/doc/getting+started[Getting Started] documentation for a number of different developer tools.

== Finding Libraries

http://search.maven.org/[Maven Central] is a searchable repository of open source JVM libraries.

https://clojars.org/[Clojars] is a community repository for open source Clojure libraries.

You can narrow Github search https://github.com/search?language=Clojure[by language] to find Clojure libraries.
