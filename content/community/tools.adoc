Community volunteers maintain <<xref/../../guides/getting_started#,Getting Started>> documentation for a number of different tools and approaches. Some of the most commonly used tools include:

== Editors/IDEs

Editors provide Clojure support via packages and extensions. While these vary in features, all of them are sufficient for Clojure development, so choose the editor that works best for you.

=== https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/[Emacs]

==== Packages and modes

* https://cider.mx/[CIDER] - Emacs packages for interactive programming in Clojure (REPL), including https://github.com/clojure-emacs/clojure-mode[clojure-mode]  major mode providing syntax highlighting, indentation, navigation and refactor support.
* https://github.com/clojure-emacs/inf-clojure[inf-clojure] - basic interaction with a Clojure subprocess (REPL), based on the popular inferior-lisp
* https://github.com/clojure-emacs/clojure-ts-mode[clojure-ts-mode] treesitter implementation of clojure-mode (in development)

==== Installation guides

* https://docs.cider.mx/cider/basics/installation.html[CIDER Getting Started Guide]
* https://practical.li/spacemacs/[Practicalli guide to Spacemacs & CIDER]
* https://www.braveclojure.com/basic-emacs/[Clojure for the Brave and True installation guide]

==== Distributions with Clojure support
