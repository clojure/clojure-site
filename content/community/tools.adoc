Community volunteers maintain <<xref/../../guides/getting_started#,Getting Started>> documentation for a number of different tools and approaches. Some of the most commonly used tools include:

== Editors

* https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/[Emacs]
** https://cider.mx/[CIDER] - extends Emacs with support for interactive programming in Clojure. The features are centered around cider-mode, an Emacs minor-mode that complements clojure-mode - https://github.com/clojure-emacs/cider[project]
** https://github.com/clojure-emacs/clojure-mode[clojure-mode] - an Emacs major mode that provides font-lock (syntax highlighting), indentation, navigation and refactoring support for the Clojure(Script)
** https://github.com/clojure-emacs/inf-clojure[inf-clojure] - provides basic interaction with a Clojure subprocess (REPL), based on ideas from the popular inferior-lisp package
** Installation and configuration guides
*** https://www.braveclojure.com/basic-emacs/[Clojure for the Brave and True installation guide]
*** https://practical.li/spacemacs/[Practicalli guide to Spacemacs]

* https://leiningen.org/[Leiningen] - an extensible build tool that provides dependency management, REPL support, testing, packaging, deployment, and many other capabilities
* https://boot-clj.github.io/[Boot] - build tooling for Clojure: instead of a special-purpose DSL, Boot supplies abstractions and libraries you can use to automate nearly any build scenario with the full power of the Clojure language

== Library repositories and catalogs

* https://clojars.org/[Clojars] - Clojure-focused Maven repository
* http://www.clojure-toolbox.com/[Clojure Toolbox] - a categorized index of Clojure libraries
