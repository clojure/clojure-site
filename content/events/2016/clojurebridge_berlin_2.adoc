We are offing this workshop to help make the Clojure community more accessible to a diverse range of participants. As such, registration is open to people who identify as a woman or have a nonbinary gender identity. Note that our coaches and organizers who will also be present at the event are members of the local Clojure community of various genders.

We'll meet up Friday late afternoon to install all of the software you need, and then spend Saturday learning and writing code. You will learn and practice in small groups of 2 to 4 attendees each.
