ClojureBridge London aims to further increase diversity within the Clojure community by offering free, beginner-friendly Clojure programming workshops for underrepresented groups in tech. Priority is given to those who identify as women, trans-gener or non-binary gender. Males may register as a guest of one of these participants.

The workshop material supports those with little or no programming experience and introduces them to programming concepts. We organise attendees into small groups with at least one teacher and one assistant.
