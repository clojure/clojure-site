ClojureBridge aims to increase diversity within the Clojure community by offering free, beginner-friendly Clojure programming workshops for underrepresented groups in tech.

We'll meet up Friday night to install all of the software you need on your laptop, and then spend Saturday learning and writing code:

- Track1: simple application
- Track2: basic syntax, data structure and more
