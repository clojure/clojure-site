ClojureBridge, a free 1-day workshop aimed at increasing the participation of women in the Clojure community, will be held in San Francisco on Saturday October 22 2016 with an optional install fest on Friday October 21 2016 in the late afternoon. The workshop is intended both for those new to programming, as well as those with some programming experience, who would like to explore programming using Clojure, a modern functional programming language.

The workshop will introduce you to fundamental programming concepts and approaches. Participants can choose between two tracks, based on their programming experience.
