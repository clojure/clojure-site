This February, Homegrown Labs presents Clojure Remote—Clojure’s first exclusively Remote conference. Join us anywhere; from your home, your office, or the coffee shop.

Over two days, you’ll join hundreds of other Clojurists online via crowdcast.io to enjoy up to two tracks of beginner to intermediate Clojure talks.
