InClojure is Indiaâ€™s first conference focused on the many joys of Clojure. The inaugural edition will be held in Pune, India on November 26th, 2016. InClojure 2016 will be a 1-day, single track conference with 5 or 6 high quality talks and plenty of time for interaction and Q&A. Our goal with this conference is to nurture the small but growing community of Clojure programmers in India. We expect to have between 100 to 150 attendees from India and abroad, with a mix of experienced Clojure programmers and enthusiasts.
