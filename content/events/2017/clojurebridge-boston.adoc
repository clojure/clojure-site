ClojureBridge Workshop is aimed at increasing women's participation in the Clojure community. A free 1-day workshop will be held in Cambridge, MA on Saturday March 18, 2017 with an optional install fest on Friday late afternoon March 17, 2017. The workshop helps explore programming using Clojure, a modern functional programming language, and is intended both for those new to programming and those with some programming experience.
