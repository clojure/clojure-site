Clojure/conj is the original conference for Clojure and its community. Founded in 2010, the conference is the premier place for developers from all around the world to gather and learn about what is happening with the language, in the community, and within organizations using Clojure.

Clojure/conj couples a session track with in-depth workshops and learning opportunities, and offers a unique opportunity to mingle with other developers, contributors, and professionals during a dense three-day event.

This year's event will be held in Baltimore, MD from October 12-14. The Conj offers a great mix of experienced Clojurists and new adopters and everyone can find something to suit their need. This will be a special year for the Conj as Clojure will celebrate it's 10th birthday!
