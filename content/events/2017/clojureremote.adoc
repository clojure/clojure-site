The second edition of Clojure Remote takes place this February 9th & 10th, 2017.

Clojure Remote is an online Clojure conference targeted at *practicing* Clojure developers. During the two-day event, you'll experience not only talks, but interactive tutorials and workshops. All these sessions will culminate in a team breakout session where you can explore the new ideas teeming in your head with speaker assistance and the help of your team.

As with https://2016.clojureremote.com[Clojure Remote 2016], videos and source from the conference will be made freely available after the conference as a gift to the community.

Clojure Remote's schedule is being developed iteratively this year. Visit the https://clojureremote.com/schedule[current schedule here], or https://clojureremote.com[the homepage] for event information and tickets.

We hope to see you and your team at the conference this year!

Cheers, +
