EuroClojure is the largest Clojure conference in Europe and draws developers from all over the continent to gather and learn what is happening with the language, in the community, and within organizations using Clojure.
This year's event will be held in Berlin, Germany from July 20-21. EuroClojure offers a great mix of experienced Clojurists and new adopters and everyone can find something to suit their needs.

EuroClojure is a Cognitect event.
