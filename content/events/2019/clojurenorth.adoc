Clojure/north is Canada's first Clojure conference. It is a non-profit event from the Clojure community for the community with three main objectives.

1. Share knowledge within the Clojure community
2. Grow the Clojure community by offering accessible talks to newcomers
3. Demonstrate with the broader community how Clojure is being used to solve problems

We hope to see you there!
