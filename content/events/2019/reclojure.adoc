We have the pleasure to invite you to https://reclojure.org[re:Clojure] - a brand new and free community driven conference, taking place in London on Dec 2nd, 2019 in an incredible venue. Many of the original ClojureX speakers will be there. Special thanks to the Clojure community and the sponsors for managing to put this together at such a short notice. We look forward to seeing you there!
