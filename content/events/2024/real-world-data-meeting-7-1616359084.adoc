== Real-world-data meeting 7

Hi! +
It is not too late to join the real-world-data group. +
This study group is a bit different from the other ones. Participants are assumed to be actively working on a problem and willing to share it. +
See the meeting 1 post for background. +
Updates about the agenda will be shared in the group chat. +
If you wish to join the group, please reach out beforehand.  +
