== core.async: Deep Dive

Core.Async: Deep Dive +
 +
An exploration of Clojure's asynchronous programming engine internals, examining what transpires beneath the public API when developers initialize asynchronous processes and transmit messages +
through channels. +
 +
  Topics covered: +
- Internal architecture of channels, queues, timers, and event loops +
  - Compilation and scheduling of virtual threads +
  - Macro system implementation for core.async semantics and code transformation into state machines +
 +
  The presentation serves language designers exploring async support, Clojure practitioners using or evaluating core.async, and systems programmers curious about CSP-style concurrency patterns. +
 +
  Speaker: Andrey Listopadov, Clojure Engineer at Health Samurai. A professional Clojure developer with 5+ years of experience, Listopadov has ported core.async to Fennel, providing deep familiarity with the +
  library's underlying mechanisms. +
