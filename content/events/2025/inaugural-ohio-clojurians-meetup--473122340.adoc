== Inaugural Ohio Clojurians meetup

If you are in Ohio &ndash; or sufficiently Ohio-adjacent &ndash; I&rsquo;m hoping to have an informal first meetup online on Tuesday, July 8th, so can get to know each other and maybe have one or more show&rsquo;n&rsquo;tell slots. 8 pm Eastern. We&rsquo;re organizing this in the #clojure-ohio channel on Clojurians Slack, including a show of hands to decide what time to kick-off. Hopefully, this will become a regular monthly event. +
