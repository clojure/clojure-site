Scicloj AI Meetup 1: voice-fn - real-time voice-enabled AI pipelines +
 +
The scicloj-ai-meetups group is a new developer community focused on AI models, their underlying principles, and practical applications. +
The group is organized by @stoica94 and @daslu, emerging from community discussions about the need for more open collaboration and experimentation in AI. It builds upon our previous initiatives like the scicloj-llm-meetups, but with an expanded scope that explores diverse types of AI models beyond just LLMs. +
While some content will be specific to the Clojure ecosystem, much of the material will be valuable and relevant to the broader AI and programming communities. +
The first meeting of this new series is scheduled for February 22, 2025. +
Agenda +
 +
@stoica94 will present voice-fn, a Clojure library for building real-time voice-enabled AI pipelines. +
We will discuss our hopes and goals for this new group. +
