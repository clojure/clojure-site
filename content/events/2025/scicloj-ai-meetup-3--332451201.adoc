Abstract +
(by @kapil) +
Large Language Models have transformed coding workflows, excelling particularly at project scaffolding and boilerplate generation. +
While Clojure&rsquo;s philosophy of composable libraries over frameworks grants exceptional power and flexibility. It also a steeper learning curve for new developers starting a project from scratch. Many of whom lament the absence of a Rails-like framework to ease their journey. +
This talk introduces a novel approach that preserves Clojure&rsquo;s library-centric philosophy while improving developer experience with LLMs. +
Key points: +
llms.edn: A structured, Clojure-native approach to describing libraries and their common usage patterns, building on concepts from llms.txt but tailored specifically for Clojure&rsquo;s ecosystem. +
LLM-powered composition workflow: A practical demonstration of how LLMs can intelligently combine libraries based on these declarations, generating cohesive starter projects that reflect Clojure&rsquo;s best practices. +
Beyond frameworks: An exploration of whether LLMs fundamentally change the library-vs-framework debate by offering &ldquo;framework-like&rdquo; convenience without sacrificing composability. +
Let&rsquo;s discuss the future of the llms.edn project and help shape a tool that could significantly enhance Clojure&rsquo;s accessibility while honouring its core design philosophy. +
Recording +
Parts of the meeting will be recorded and may be shared publicly. +
Some parts will remain unrecorded. +
