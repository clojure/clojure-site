== SciNoj Light 1st conference

In recent months, the Clojure toolkit for data and science has been maturing. Thus, in 2025, Scicloj can finally shift more resources into making it accessible and well-known. +
SciNoj Light is one of the first steps in that direction. +
SciNoj Light is an online conference where Clojurians will share their short-term data analysis. +
