== Clojure real-world-data 40

Hi! The real-world-data group now meets regularly every week. +
  In the coming period, we will focus on community projects and library development, but people are invited to propose additional topics to discuss and share. +
  The main topics for the coming meetings will be Clay, Clojure Civitas, and a new plotting library (continuing Tableplot). +
  Updates about the agenda will be shared in the group chat: the real-world-data channel at the Zulip chat (requires login). +
  If you wish to join the group, please reach out beforehand, and we&rsquo;ll add you to the calendar event.  +
