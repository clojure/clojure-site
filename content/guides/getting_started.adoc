Welcome to Clojure!

Check out <<learn/syntax#,Learn Clojure>>, <<xref/../../community/resources#,Resources>>, or <<xref/../../community/books#,Books>> for learning the language!

== Clojure installer and CLI tools

Clojure provides <<deps_and_cli#,command line tools>> that can be used to start a Clojure repl, use Clojure and Java libraries, and start Clojure programs.

=== Installation on Mac via https://brew.sh[Homebrew]

Install the command line tools with `brew`:

[source,shell]
----
brew install clojure
----

If you've already installed, you can upgrade to the latest release with:

[source,shell]
----
brew upgrade clojure
----

=== Installation on Linux

1. Ensure that the following dependencies are installed: bash, curl, rlwrap, and Java.
2. Use the linux-install script to download and run the install, which will create /usr/local/bin/clj, /usr/local/bin/clojure, and /usr/local/lib/clojure:

[source,shell]
----
curl -O https://download.clojure.org/install/linux-install-1.10.1.492.sh
chmod +x linux-install-1.10.1.492.sh
sudo ./linux-install-1.10.1.492.sh
----

=== Installation on Windows

An early release version of clj on Windows is available at https://github.com/clojure/tools.deps.alpha/wiki/clj-on-Windows[clj on Windows].
Please provide feedback at https://clojure.atlassian.net/projects/TDEPS.

== Other ways to run Clojure

*Local build*

Download and build Clojure from source (requires Git, Java, and Maven):

[source,shell]
----
git clone https://github.com/clojure/clojure.git
cd clojure
mvn -Plocal -Dmaven.test.skip=true package
----

Then start the REPL with the local jar:

[source,shell]
----
java -jar clojure.jar
----

*Try Clojure online*

https://repl.it/languages/clojure[repl.it] provides a browser-based Clojure repl for interactive exploration.

*Build tools*

Build tools provide a range of capabilities for building, running, and deploying Clojure libraries and applications. The two most popular Clojure build tools are https://leiningen.org/[Leiningen] and http://boot-clj.com/[Boot].
