Here is a list of useful REPL-related resources by the Clojure community:

* In https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qx0-pViyIDU[Running with Scissors: Live Coding with Data] (slides https://github.com/stuarthalloway/presentations/wiki/Running-with-Scissors[here]), Stuart Halloway presents his workflow for solving problems with the REPL, including little-known opportunities offered by the Clojure REPL without 3rd-party tools (such as custom reading). _"You're living in your program invoking your tools, instead of living in your tools invoking your program"._
* https://lambdaisland.com/guides/clojure-repls[The Ultimate Guide to Clojure REPLs] on Lambda Island:
this tutorial notably explores the wide variety of Clojure REPLs and related technology.
* https://vimeo.com/223309989[Stuart Halloway on REPL Driven Development]: a talk which reflects on the added value 
of REPLs compared to shells, and provides guidelines for using the Clojure REPL.
* https://clojureverse.org/t/share-the-nitty-gritty-details-of-your-clojure-workflow/1208[Share the nitty-gritty details of your Clojure workflow]:
a ClojureVerse discussion where community members describe their development configurations and how they use it them in details.
* https://vvvvalvalval.github.io/posts/what-makes-a-good-repl.html[What makes a good REPL?]: this blog post provides 
a general reflection on the benefits of REPLs, and the programming language features which enable them.
* https://vimeo.com/230220635[REPL-Based Development Demo]: a video showing how the REPL is used for development 
on an example project.
* The https://gist.github.com/daveray/1441520[Seesaw REPL Tutorial] teaches you to build Graphical User Interfaces 
at the Clojure REPL.
