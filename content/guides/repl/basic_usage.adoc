== Evaluating Clojure expressions

Having started the REPL (as described <<launching_a_basic_repl#,in the previous chapter>>), 
you can now evaluate Clojure expressions by simply typing them into the REPL and pressing ENTER:

[source,clojure-repl]
----
user=> (+ 2 3)
5
user=> (defn factorial [n]
(if (= n 0)
  1
  (* n (factorial (dec n)))))
#'user/factorial
user=> (factorial 10)
3628800
user=>
----

Under each expression, we see the _result_ of evaluating the expression.
 This is what a REPL does: for each expression that we submit to it, the REPL **R**eads it,
 **E**valuates it, then **P**rints the result, all of this in a **L**oop.

[NOTE]
====
If you are in the process of learning Clojure, take some time to experiment at the REPL.
The rapid feedback loop it provides makes for a very effective learning environment.
====

Although the above examples are very basic, you can run full-featured Clojure programs
 in this way. Clojure was designed so that its REPL environment provides the full power of the language:
 you could actually run any existing Clojure program simply by pasting the content of the source files
 in the right order into the REPL.

[TIP]
====
**TIP: using an editor next to your REPL**

Editing Clojure code inside the terminal window can get tedious; when that is the case,
 one simple trick is to write the code in a text editor of your choosing that has a syntax-aware
 Clojure mode, and copy and paste code from the editor to the REPL terminal window. Here's an
 example of what this looks like (the editor used is https://atom.io/packages/language-clojure/[Atom]):

image:/images/content/guides/repl/editor-cli-repl.gif["Editor next to CLI REPL"]

In the _<<enhancing_your_repl_workflow#,Enhancing your REPL workflow>>_ chapter of this guide, 
we will see more ergonomic configurations for using the REPL. 
However, this minimalist setup is sufficient for the scope of this tutorial,
and is important for mastering the fundamentals.

== The 2 flavors of printing

Consider the following evaluation:

[source,clojure-repl]
----
user=> (println "Hello World")
Hello World
nil
----

This is strange: unlike the previous examples, it looks like evaluating the `(println "Hello World")` expression
 yielded 2 results: `Hello World` and `nil`.

This is because the https://clojure.github.io/clojure/clojure.core-api.html#clojure.core/println[println]
 function _prints_ its argument to the standard output but _returns_ nil.
 Therefore, the 2 lines we see under our expression are very different in nature:

* `Hello World` is a _side effect_ of evaluating the expression (printing to standard output): the printing was done by our code.
* `nil` is the _result_ of evaluating the expression: the printing was done by the REPL.

== Calling Clojure libs from the REPL

So far, we have only called code that we had defined manually at the REPL (for instance our `factorial` function defined above).
But the REPL also lets you use pre-existing Clojure code, i.e Clojure <<xref/../../../reference/libs#,libs>>.footnote:[
Note that what we call a Clojure <<xref/../../../reference/libs#,lib>> is not necessarily a https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Library_(computing)[library]:
it can also be a source code file in your current project.]
Given a Clojure lib with namespace `my.name.space`, you can evaluate `(https://clojure.github.io/clojure/clojure.core-api.html#clojure.core/require[require] '[my.name.space])`
 to make that lib's code loaded and available in the REPL.

=== Example: using clojure.string

For example, `https://clojure.github.io/clojure/clojure.string-api.html[clojure.string]`
 is a lib bundled with Clojure for manipulating text.
 Let's require `clojure.string` and call its `clojure.string/upper-case` function:

[source,clojure-repl]
----
user=> (require '[clojure.string])
nil
user=> (clojure.string/upper-case "clojure")
"CLOJURE"
----

`https://clojure.github.io/clojure/clojure.core-api.html#clojure.core/require[require]` also lets use
 define an _alias_ for the `clojure.string` namespace, by adding an `:as` clause. This enables us to
 refer to names defined in the `clojure.string` namespace more concisely:

[source,clojure-repl]
----
user=> (require '[clojure.string :as str])
nil
user=> (str/upper-case "clojure")
"CLOJURE"
----

Finally, if we're _very_ lazy and don't want to type an alias at all, we can add a `:refer` clause:

[source,clojure-repl]
----
user=> (require '[clojure.string :refer [upper-case]])
nil
user=> (upper-case "clojure")
"CLOJURE"
----

== Looking up documentation

The REPL can also be used for looking up API documentation, using the `https://clojure.github.io/clojure/clojure.repl-api.html[clojure.repl]` lib.
 Evaluate the following expression at the REPL:

[source,clojure-repl]
----
user=> (require '[clojure.repl :refer :all])
nil
----

This expression makes all the names defined in the `clojure.repl` namespace available in the REPL.

==== doc
You can print the API documentation of a given Var by evaluating `(https://clojuredocs.org/clojure.repl/doc[doc] MY-VAR-NAME)`:

[source,clojure-repl]
----
user=> (doc nil?)
-------------------------
clojure.core/nil?
([x])
  Returns true if x is nil, false otherwise.
nil
user=> (doc clojure.string/upper-case)
-------------------------
clojure.string/upper-case
([s])
  Converts string to all upper-case.
nil
----

==== source
You can also view the source code that was used to define a Var using `https://clojuredocs.org/clojure.repl/source[source]`:

[source,clojure-repl]
----
user=> (source some?)
(defn some?
  "Returns true if x is not nil, false otherwise."
  {:tag Boolean
   :added "1.6"
   :static true}
  [x] (not (nil? x)))
nil
----

==== dir
You can use `https://clojuredocs.org/clojure.repl/dir[dir]` to list the names of all the Vars defined a given namespace.
 Let's do this with the `clojure.string` namespace:

[source,clojure-repl]
----
user=> (dir clojure.string)
blank?
capitalize
ends-with?
escape
includes?
index-of
join
last-index-of
lower-case
re-quote-replacement
replace
replace-first
reverse
split
split-lines
starts-with?
trim
trim-newline
triml
trimr
upper-case
nil
----

As another example, let's use `dir` to see what's available in `clojure.repl` itself:

[source,clojure-repl]
----
user=> (dir clojure.repl)
apropos
demunge
dir
dir-fn
doc
find-doc
pst
root-cause
set-break-handler!
source
source-fn
stack-element-str
thread-stopper
nil
----

We recognize the `doc`, `source` and `dir` operations we've used so far.

==== apropos

If you don't exactly remember the name of some Var, you can search for it
 using `https://clojuredocs.org/clojure.repl/apropos[apropos]`:

[source,clojure-repl]
----
user=> (apropos "index")
(clojure.core/indexed? clojure.core/keep-indexed clojure.core/map-indexed clojure.string/index-of clojure.string/last-index-of)
----

`https://clojuredocs.org/clojure.repl/apropos[apropos]` only searches Var names; you can search docstrings
 (the text that is printed by `https://clojuredocs.org/clojure.repl/doc[doc]`) using
 `https://clojuredocs.org/clojure.repl/find-doc[find-doc]`:

==== find-doc
[source,clojure-repl]
----
user=> (find-doc "indexed")
-------------------------
clojure.core/contains?
([coll key])
 Returns true if key is present in the given collection, otherwise
 returns false.  Note that for numerically indexed collections like
 vectors and Java arrays, this tests if the numeric key is within the
 range of indexes. 'contains?' operates constant or logarithmic time;
 it will not perform a linear search for a value.  See also 'some'.
-------------------------
clojure.core/indexed?
([coll])
 Return true if coll implements Indexed, indicating efficient lookup by index
-------------------------
clojure.core/keep-indexed
([f] [f coll])
 Returns a lazy sequence of the non-nil results of (f index item). Note,
 this means false return values will be included.  f must be free of
 side-effects.  Returns a stateful transducer when no collection is
 provided.
-------------------------
clojure.core/map-indexed
([f] [f coll])
 Returns a lazy sequence consisting of the result of applying f to 0
 and the first item of coll, followed by applying f to 1 and the second
 item in coll, etc, until coll is exhausted. Thus function f should
 accept 2 arguments, index and item. Returns a stateful transducer when
 no collection is provided.
nil
----

[WARNING]
====
**Documentation is available only for libs that have been required.**

For instance, if you have not required the `clojure.set` namespace, you won't be
able to search documentation for `clojure.set/union`. This is illustrated by this
example REPL session:

[source,clojure-repl]
----
clj
Clojure 1.10.0
user=> (doc clojure.set/union)
nil                             ;; no doc found
user=> (apropos "union")
()
user=> (require '[clojure.set]) ;; now we're requiring clojure.set
nil
user=> (doc clojure.set/union)
-------------------------
clojure.set/union
([] [s1] [s1 s2] [s1 s2 & sets])
  Return a set that is the union of the input sets
nil
user=> (apropos "union")
(clojure.set/union)
user=>
----
