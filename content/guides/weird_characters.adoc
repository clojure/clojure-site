This page explains the Clojure syntax for characters that are difficult to "google".
Sections are not in any particular order, but related items
are grouped for ease. 
Please refer to <<xref/../../reference/reader#,the reader reference page>>
as the authoritative reference on the Clojure reader.
This guide is based on http://twitter.com/kouphax[James Hughes]
original https://yobriefca.se/blog/2014/05/19/the-weird-and-wonderful-characters-of-clojure/[blog post] and has been updated and expanded here with the permission of the author.

[[lists]]
== `( ... )` - List

Lists are sequential heterogeneous collections implemented as a linked list.

* <<xref/../../reference/data_structures#Lists,Clojure Documentation: Lists>>

A list of three values:

[source,clojure]
----
(1 "two" 3.0)
----

[[vectors]]
== `[ ... ]` - Vector

Vectors are sequential, indexed, heterogeneous collections. Indexing is 0-based.

An example of retrieving the value at index 1 in a vector of three values:

[source,clojure]
----
user=> (get ["a" 13.7 :foo] 1)
13.7
----

* <<xref/../../reference/data_structures#Vectors,Clojure Documentation: Vectors>>

[[maps]]
== `{ ... }` - Map

Maps are heterogeneous collections specified with alternating keys and values:

[source,clojure]
----
user=> (keys {:a 1 :b 2})
(:a :b)
----

* <<xref/../../reference/data_structures#Maps,Clojure Documentation: Maps>>

[[dispatch]]
== `#` - Dispatch character

You'll see this character beside another e.g. `\#(` or `#"`.

`#` is a special character that tells the Clojure reader (the component that takes Clojure
source and "reads" it as Clojure data) how to interpret the next character using a _read table_. Although some Lisps allow the read table to be extended by users, Clojure <<faq#reader_macros,does not>>.

The `#` is also used at the _end_ of a symbol when creating  <<xref/../weird_characters#gensym,generated symbols>> inside a syntax quote.

== `#{ ... }` - Set

See <<xref/../weird_characters#dispatch,`#`>> for additional details.

`#{...}` defines a set (a collection of unique values), specifically a `hash-set`. The
following are equivalent:

[source,clojure]
----
user=> #{1 2 3 4}
#{1 2 3 4}
user=> (hash-set 1 2 3 4)
#{1 2 3 4}
----

Sets cannot contain duplicates and thus the `set` reader will throw an exception in this case as it is an invalid literal. When items are added to a set, they are simply dropped if the value is already present.

[source, clojure]
----
user=> #{1 2 3 4 1}
Syntax error reading source at (REPL:83:13).
Duplicate key: 1
----

* <<xref/../../reference/data_structures#sets,Clojure Documentation: Sets>>

== `#_` - Discard

See <<xref/../weird_characters#dispatch,`#`>> for additional details.

`#_` tells the reader to ignore the next form completely.

[source,clojure]
----
user=> [1 2 3 #_ 4 5]
[1 2 3 5]
----
Note that the space following `#_` is optional, so
[source,clojure]
----
user=> [1 2 3 #_4 5]
[1 2 3 5]
----
also works. Also note that the discard character works in edn.

A neat trick is that multiple `#_` can be stacked to omit multiple forms
[source,clojure]
----
user=> {:a 1, #_#_ :b 2, :c 3}
{:a 1, :c 3}
----

The docs suggest that "The form following `#_` is completely skipped by the reader
(This is a more complete removal than the `comment` macro which yields `nil`).".
This can prove useful for debugging situations or for multiline comments.

* <<xref/../../reference/reader#,Clojure Documentation - Reader>>
* https://github.com/edn-format/edn#tagged-elements[edn Tagged Elements]

== `#"..."` - Regular Expression

See <<xref/../weird_characters#dispatch,`#`>> for additional details.

`#"` indicates the start of a regular expression

[source,clojure]
----
user=> (re-matches #"^test$" "test")
"test"
----

This form is compiled at _read time_ into a host-specific regex machinery, but
it is not available in edn. Note that when using regexes in Clojure,
Java string escaping is not required

* <<xref/../../reference/other_functions#regex,Clojure Documentation: Regex Support>>
* http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/regex/Pattern.html[Java Regex]

== `#(...)` - Anonymous function

See <<xref/../weird_characters#dispatch,`#`>> for additional details.

`#(` begins the short hand syntax for an inline function definition. The
following two snippets of code are similar:

[source,clojure]
----
; anonymous function taking a single argument and printing it
(fn [line] (println line))

; anonymous function taking a single argument and printing it - shorthand
#(println %)
----

The reader expands an anonymous function into a function definition whose
arity (the number of arguments it takes) is defined by how the `%` placeholders
are declared. See the `%` character for discussion around arity.

[source,clojure]
----
user=> (macroexpand `#(println %))
(fn* [arg] (clojure.core/println arg)) ; argument names shortened for clarity
----

== `#'` - Var quote

`#'` is the var quote which expands into a call to the `var` function:

[source,clojure]
----
user=> (read-string "#'foo")
(var foo)
user=> (def nine 9)
#'user/nine
user=> nine
9
user=> (var nine)
#'user/nine
user=> #'nine
#'user/nine
----
When used it will attempt to return the referenced var. This is useful when
you want to talk about the reference/declaration instead of the value it represents.
See the use of `meta` in the metadata (<<xref/../weird_characters#metadata,`^`>>) discussion.

Note that var quote is not available in edn.

* <<xref/../../reference/special_forms#var,Clojure Official Documentation: Special Forms>>

== `pass:[##]` - Symbolic values

Clojure can read and print the symbolic values `pass:[##Inf]`,
`pass:[##-Inf]`, and `pass:[##NaN]`.  These are also available in edn.

[source,clojure]
----
user=> (/ 1.0 0.0)
##Inf
user=> (/ -1.0 0.0)
##-Inf
user=> (Math/sqrt -1.0)
##NaN
----

[[tagged_literals]]
== `#inst`, `#uuid`, and `#js` etc. - tagged literals

Tagged literals are defined in edn and supported by the Clojure and
ClojureScript readers natively. The `#inst` and `#uuid` tags are defined by edn,
whereas the #js tag is defined by ClojureScript.

We can use Clojure's `read-string` to read a tagged literal (or use it directly):
[source,clojure]
----
user=> (type #inst "2014-05-19T19:12:37.925-00:00")
java.util.Date ;; this is host dependent
(read-string "#inst \"2014-05-19T19:12:37.925-00:00\"")
#inst "2014-05-19T19:12:37.925-00:00"
----

A tagged literal tells the reader how to parse the literal value. Other common
uses include `#uuid` for expressing UUIDs and in the ClojureScript world an
extremely common use of tagged literals is `#js` which can be used to convert
ClojureScript data structures into JavaScript structures directly. Note that
`#js` doesn't convert recursively, so if you have a nested data-structure, use
https://cljs.github.io/api/cljs.core/js-GTclj[`pass:[js->clj]`].

Note that while `#inst` and `#uuid` are available in edn, `#js` is not.

* https://github.com/edn-format/edn#tagged-elements[edn Tagged Elements]

== `%`, `%n`, `%&` - Anonymous function arguments

`%` is an argument in an anonymous function `#(...)` as in `#(* % %)`.

When an anonymous function is expanded, it becomes an `fn` form and `%` args are replaced with gensym'ed names
(here we use arg1, etc for readability):

[source,clojure]
----
user=> (macroexpand `#(println %))
(fn* [arg1] (clojure.core/println arg1)) 
----

Numbers can be placed directly after the `%` to indicate the argument positions (1-based).
Anonymous function arity is determined based on the highest number `%` argument.

[source,clojure]
----
user=> (macroexpand `#(println %1 %2))
(fn* [arg1 arg2] (clojure.core/println arg1 arg2)) ; takes 2 args

user=> (macroexpand `#(println %4))
(fn* [arg1 arg2 arg3 arg4] (clojure.core/println arg4)) ; takes 4 args doesn't use 3
----

You don't have to use the arguments, but you do need to declare them in the order
you'd expect an external caller to pass them in.

`%` and `%1` can be used interchangeably:
[source,clojure]
----
user=> (macroexpand `#(println % %1)) ; use both % and %1
(fn* [arg1] (clojure.core/println arg1 arg1)) ; still only takes 1 argument
----
There is also `%&` which is the symbol used in a variadic anonymous function
to represent the "rest" of the arguments (after the highest named anonymous
argument).

[source,clojure]
----
user=> (macroexpand '#(println %&))
(fn* [& rest__11#] (println rest__11#))
----

Anonymous functions and `%` are not part of edn.

== `@` - Deref

`@` expands into a call to the `deref` function, so these two forms
are the same:
[source,clojure]
----
user=> (def x (atom 1))
#'user/x
user=> @x
1
user=> (deref x)
1
user=>
----
`@` is used to get the current value of a reference. The above example uses
`@` to get the current value of an <<xref/../../reference/atom#,atom>>, but `@` can
be applied to other things such as `future` s, `delay` s, `promises` s etc. to
force computation and potentially block.

Note that `@` is not available in edn.

== `^` (and `#^`) - Metadata

`^` is the metadata marker. Metadata is a map of values (with shorthand option)
that can be attached to various forms in Clojure. This provides extra information
for these forms and can be used for documentation, compilation warnings,
typehints, and other features.
[source,clojure]
----
user=> (def ^{:debug true} five 5) ; meta map with single boolean value
#'user/five
----

We can access the metadata by the `meta` function which should be executed
against the declaration itself (rather than the returned value):
[source,clojure]
----
user=> (def ^{:debug true} five 5)
#'user/five
user=> (meta #'five)
{:ns #<Namespace user>, :name five, :column 1, :debug true, :line 1, :file "NO_SOURCE_PATH"}
----
As we have a single value here, we can use a shorthand notation for declaring
the metadata `^:name` which is useful for flags, as the value will be set to true.
[source,clojure]
----
user=> (def ^:debug five 5)
#'user/five
user=> (meta #'five)
{:ns #<Namespace user>, :name five, :column 1, :debug true, :line 1, :file "NO_SOURCE_PATH"}
----
Another use of `^` is for type hints. These are used to tell the compiler what
type the value will be and allow it to perform type specific optimizations
thus potentially making resultant code faster:
[source,clojure]
----
user=> (def ^Integer five 5)
#'user/five
user=> (meta #'five)
{:ns #<Namespace user>, :name five, :column 1, :line 1, :file "NO_SOURCE_PATH", :tag java.lang.Integer}
----
We can see in that example the `:tag` property is set.

You can also stack the shorthand notations:
[source,clojure]
----
user=> (def ^Integer ^:debug ^:private five 5)
#'user/five
user=> (meta #'five)
{:ns #<Namespace user>, :name five, :column 1, :private true, :debug true, :line 1, :file "NO_SOURCE_PATH", :tag java.lang.Integer}
----

Originally, meta was declared with `pass:[#^]`, which is now deprecated (but still works). Later, this was simplified to just `^` and that is what you will see in most Clojure, but occasionally you will encounter the `pass:[#^]` syntax in older code.

Note that metadata is available in edn, but type hints are not.

* http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Learning_Clojure/Meta_Data[Learning Clojure: Meta Data]

== `'` - Quote

Quoting is used to indicate that the next form should be read but not evaluated.
The reader expands `'` into a call to the `quote` special form.

[source,clojure]
----
user=> (1 3 4) ; fails as it tries to invoke 1 as a function

Execution error (ClassCastException) at myproject.person-names/eval230 (REPL:1).
class java.lang.Long cannot be cast to class clojure.lang.IFn

user=> '(1 3 4) ; quote
(1 3 4)

user=> (quote (1 2 3)) ; using the longer quote method
(1 2 3)
user=>
----

* <<xref/../../reference/special_forms#quote,Clojure Special Forms>>

== `;` - Comment

`;` starts a line comment and ignores all input from its starting point to the end of the
line.
[source,clojure]
----
user=> (def x "x") ; this is a comment
#'user/x
user=> ; this is a comment too
<returns nothing>
----

It is common in Clojure to use multiple semicolons for readability or emphasis,
but these are all the same to Clojure

[source,clojure]
----
;; This is probably more important than

; this
----

== `:` - Keyword

`:` is the indicator for a keyword. Keywords are often used as keys in maps and
they provide faster comparisons and lower memory overhead than strings (because instances are cached and reused).

[source,clojure]
----
user=> (type :test)
clojure.lang.Keyword
----
Alternatively you can use the `keyword` function to create a keyword from a string
[source,clojure]
----
user=> (keyword "test")
:test
----
Keywords can also be invoked as functions to look themselves up as a key in a map:
[source,clojure]
----
user=> (def my-map {:one 1 :two 2})
#'user/my-map
user=> (:one my-map) ; get the value for :one by invoking it as function
1
user=> (:three my-map) ; it can safely check for missing keys
nil
user=> (:three my-map 3) ; it can return a default if specified
3
user => (get my-map :three 3) ; same as above, but using get
3
----

* <<xref/../../reference/data_structures#Keywords,Data Structures - Keywords>>

[[autoresolved_keys]]
== `::` - Auto-resolved keyword

`::` is used to auto-resolve a keyword in the current namespace. If no qualifier
is specified, it will auto-resolve to the current namespace. If a qualifier is
specified, it may use aliases in the current namespace:
[source,clojure]
----
user=> :my-keyword
:my-keyword
user=> ::my-keyword
:user/my-keyword
user=> (= ::my-keyword :my-keyword)
false
----
This is useful when creating macros. If you want to ensure that a macro that calls
another function in the macro namespace correctly expands to call the function,
you could use `::my-function` to refer to the fully qualified name.

Note that `::` is not available in edn.

* <<xref/../../reference/reader#,Reader>>

== `pass:[#:]` and `#::` - Namespace Map Syntax

Namespace map syntax was added in Clojure 1.9 and is used to specify a default
namespace context when keys or symbols in a map where they share a
common namespace.

The `pass:[#:ns]` syntax specifies a fully-qualified namespace map prefix n alias 
in the namespace map prefix with, where _ns_ is the name of a namespace and the prefix
precedes the opening brace `{` of the map.

For example, the following map literal with namespace syntax:
[source,clojure]
----
#:person{:first "Han"
         :last "Solo"
         :ship #:ship{:name "Millennium Falcon"
                      :model "YT-1300f light freighter"}}
----
is read as:
[source,clojure]
----
{:person/first "Han"
 :person/last "Solo"
 :person/ship {:ship/name "Millennium Falcon"
               :ship/model "YT-1300f light freighter"}}
----

Note that these maps represent the identical object - these are just alternate syntaxes.

`#::` can be used to auto-resolve the namespace of keyword or symbol keys
in a map using the current namespace.

These two examples are equivalent:

[source,clojure]
----
user=> (keys {:user/a 1, :user/b 2})
(:user/a :user/b)
user=> (keys #::{:a 1, :b 2})
(:user/a :user/b)
----

Similar to <<xref/../weird_characters#autoresolved_keys,autoresolved keywords>>,
you can also use `#::alias` to auto-resolve with a namespace alias defined in
the `ns` form:

[source,clojure]
----
(ns rebel.core
  (:require 
    [rebel.person :as p]
    [rebel.ship   :as s] ))

#::p{:first "Han"
     :last "Solo"
     :ship #::s{:name "Millennium Falcon"
                :model "YT-1300f light freighter"}}
----

is read the same as:

[source,clojure]
----
{:rebel.person/first "Han"
 :rebel.person/last "Solo"
 :rebel.person/ship {:rebel.ship/name "Millennium Falcon"
                     :rebel.ship/model "YT-1300f light freighter"}}
----

* <<xref/../../reference/reader#map_namespace_syntax,Reader>>

== `/` - Namespace separator

`/` can be the division function `clojure.core//`, but can also act as a
separator in a symbol name to separate a symbol's name and namespace qualifier, e.g. `my-namespace/utils`. Namespace qualifiers can thus prevent naming collisions
for simple names.

* <<xref/../../reference/reader#,Reader>>

== `\` - Character literal

`\` indicates a literal character as in:

[source,clojure]
----
user=> (str \h \i)
"hi"
----

There are also a small number of special characters to name special ASCII characters: `\newline`, `\space`, `\tab`, `\formfeed`, `\backspace`, and `\return`.

The `\` can also be followed by a Unicode literal of the form `\uNNNN`. For example, `\u03A9` is the literal for Ω.




== `$` - Inner class reference

Used to reference inner classes and interfaces in Java. Separates the
container class name and the inner class name.
[source,clojure]
----
(import (basex.core BaseXClient$EventNotifier)

(defn- build-notifier [notifier-action]
  (reify BaseXClient$EventNotifier
    (notify [this value]
      (notifier-action value))))
----

`EventNotifier` is an inner interface of the `BaseXClient` class which is an
imported Java class

* http://blog.jayfields.com/2011/01/clojure-using-java-inner-classes.html[Clojure: Using Java Inner Classes]
* <<xref/../../reference/java_interop#,Official Documentation>>

== `pass:[->]`, `pass:[->>]`, `pass:[some->]`, `pass:[cond->]`, `pass:[as->]` etc. - Threading macros

These are threading macros. Please refer to <<xref/../threading_macros#,Official Clojure Documentation>>

* http://blog.fogus.me/2009/09/04/understanding-the-clojure-macro/[Understanding the Clojure +->+ macro]

[[syntax_quote]]
== ````` - Syntax quote

````` is the syntax quote. Syntax quote is similar to quoting (to delay 
evaluation) but has some additional effects.

Basic syntax quote may look similar to normal quoting:

[source,clojure]
----
user=> (1 2 3)
Execution error (ClassCastException) at myproject.person-names/eval232 (REPL:1).
class java.lang.Long cannot be cast to class clojure.lang.IFn
user=> `(1 2 3)
(1 2 3)
----

However, symbols used within a syntax quote are fully resolved with respect to the 
current namespace:

[source,clojure]
----
user=> (def five 5)
#'user/five
user=> `five
user/five
----

Syntax quote is most used as a "template" mechanism within macros. We can write one now:

[source,clojure]
----
user=> (defmacro debug [body]
  #_=>   `(let [val# ~body]
  #_=>      (println "DEBUG: " val#)
  #_=>      val#))
#'user/debug
user=> (debug (+ 2 2))
DEBUG:  4
4
----

Macros are functions invoked by the compiler with code as data. They are expected
to return code (as data) that can be further compiled and evaluated. 
This macro takes a single body expression and returns a `let` form that will 
evaluate the body, print its value, and then return the value. Here the syntax
quote creates a list, but does not evaluate it. That list is actually code.

See <<xref/../weird_characters#unquote_splicing,`~@`>> and <<xref/../weird_characters#unquote,`~`>> for additional syntax allowed only within syntax quote.

* http://www.braveclojure.com/writing-macros/[Clojure for the Brave and True - Writing Macros]
* http://aphyr.com/posts/305-clojure-from-the-ground-up-macros[Clojure from the ground up: macros]
* <<xref/../../reference/macros#,Clojure Official Documentation>>

[[unqote]]
== `~` - Unquote

See <<xref/../weird_characters#syntax_quote,```>> for additional information.

`~` is unquote. That is within a syntax quoted <<xref/../weird_characters#syntax_quote,```>> form `~` will _unquote_
the associated symbol, i.e. evaluate it in the current context:
[source,clojure]
----
user=> (def five 5) ; create a named var with the value 5
#'user/five
user=> five ; the symbol five is evaluated to its value
5
user=> `five ; syntax quoting five will avoid evaluating the symbol, and fully resolve it
user/five
user=> `~five ; within a syntax quoted block, ~ will turn evaluation back on just for the next form
5
----

Syntax quoting and unquote are essential tools for writing macros, which are functions invoked during compilation that take code and return code.

* http://www.braveclojure.com/writing-macros/[Clojure for the Brave and True - Writing Macros]
* http://aphyr.com/posts/305-clojure-from-the-ground-up-macros[Clojure from the ground up: macros]
* <<xref/../../macros#,Clojure Official Documentation>>

[[unquote_splicing]]
== `~@` - Unquote splicing

See <<xref/../weird_characters#syntax_quote,```>> and <<xref/../weird_characters#unquote,`~`>> for additional information.

`~@` is unquote-splicing. Where unquote <<xref/../weird_characters#unquote,(`~`)>>
evaluates a form and places the result into the quoted result, `~@` expects the
evaluated value to be a collection and splices the _contents_ of that 
collection into the quoted result.
[source,clojure]
----
user=> (def three-and-four (list 3 4))
#'user/three-and-four
user=> `(1 ~three-and-four) ; evaluates `three-and-four` and places it in the result
(1 (3 4))
user=> `(1 ~@three-and-four) ;  evaluates `three-and-four` and places its contents in the result
(1 3 4)
----

Again, this is a powerful tool for writing macros.

* <<xref/../../macros#,Clojure Official Documentation>>

[[gensym]]
== `<symbol>#` - Gensym

A `#` _at the end_ of a symbol is used to automatically generate a new symbol.
This is useful inside macros to keep macro specifics from leaking into the
userspace. A regular `let` will fail in a macro definition:

[source,clojure]
----
user=> (defmacro m [] `(let [x 1] x))
#'user/m
user=> (m)
Syntax error macroexpanding clojure.core/let at (REPL:1:1).
myproject.person-names/x - failed: simple-symbol? at: [:bindings :form :local-symbol]
  spec: :clojure.core.specs.alpha/local-name
myproject.person-names/x - failed: vector? at: [:bindings :form :seq-destructure]
  spec: :clojure.core.specs.alpha/seq-binding-form
myproject.person-names/x - failed: map? at: [:bindings :form :map-destructure]
  spec: :clojure.core.specs.alpha/map-bindings
myproject.person-names/x - failed: map? at: [:bindings :form :map-destructure]
  spec: :clojure.core.specs.alpha/map-special-binding
----

This is because symbols inside a syntax quote are fully resolved, including the
local binding `x` here.

Instead you can append `#` to the end of the variable name and let Clojure
generate a unique (unqualified) symbol:

[source, clojure]
----
user=> (defmacro m [] `(let [x# 1] x#))
#'user/m
user=> (m)
1
user=>
----

Importantly, every time a particular `x#` is used within a single syntax quote, the _same_ generated name will be used.

If we expand this macro, we can see the `gensym` 'd name:

[source, clojure]
----
user=> (macroexpand '(m))
(let* [x__681__auto__ 1] x__681__auto__)
----

* http://clojuredocs.org/clojure_core/clojure.core/gensym[ClojureDocs - gensym]

== `#?` - Reader conditional

Reader conditionals are designed to allow different dialects of Clojure
to share common code. The reader conditional behaves similarly to a traditional
`cond`. The syntax for usage is `#?` and looks like this:

[source,clojure]
----
#?(:clj  (Clojure expression)
   :cljs (ClojureScript expression)
   :cljr (Clojure CLR expression)
   :default (fallthrough expression))
----

* <<xref/../reader_conditionals#,Reader conditionals>>

== `#?@` - Splicing Reader conditional

The syntax for a splicing reader conditional is `#?@`. It is used to splice
lists into the containing form. So the Clojure reader would read this:
[source,clojure]
----
(defn build-list []
  (list #?@(:clj  [5 6 7 8]
            :cljs [1 2 3 4])))
----
as this:
[source,clojure]
----
(defn build-list []
  (list 5 6 7 8))
----
* <<xref/../reader_conditionals#,Reader conditonals>>

== `\*var-name*` - "Earmuffs"

Earmuffs (a pair of asterisk bookending var names) is a naming convention in
many LISPs used to denote _special vars_. Most commonly in Clojure this is
used to denote _dynamic_ vars, i.e. ones that can change depending on
dynamic scope. The earmuffs act as a warning that "here be dragons"
and to never assume the state of the var. Remember, this is a convention, not a
rule.

Core Clojure examples include `\*out*` and `\*in*` which represent the standard in
and out streams for Clojure.

== `>!!`, `<!!`, `>!`, and `<!` - core.async channel macros

These symbols are channel operations in https://github.com/clojure/core.async[`core.async`]
- a Clojure/ClojureScript library for channel based asynchronous programming
(specifically http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communicating_sequential_processes[CSP - Communicating Sequential Processes]).

If you imagine, for the sake of argument, a channel is a bit like a queue that
things can put stuff on and take stuff off, then these symbols support that
simple API.

* `>!!` and `<!!` are _blocking put_ and _take_ respectively
* `>!` and `<!` are, simply _put_ and _take_

THe difference being the blocking version operate outside `go` blocks and block
the thread they operate on.
[source,clojure]
----
user=> (def my-channel (chan 10)) ; create a channel
user=> (>!! my-channel "hello")   ; put stuff on the channel
user=> (println (<!! my-channel)) ; take stuff off the channel
hello
----
The non-blocking versions need to be executed within a `go` block, otherwise
they'll throw an exception.
[source,clojure]
----
user=> (def c (chan))
#'user/c
user=> (>! c "nope")
AssertionError Assert failed: >! used not in (go ...) block
nil  clojure.core.async/>! (async.clj:123)
----
While the difference between these is well outside the scope of this guide,
fundamentally the `go` blocks operate and manage their own resources pausing
*execution* of code without blocking threads. This makes asynchronously executed
code appear to be synchronous, removing the pain of managing
asynchronous code from the code base.

== `<symbol>?` - Predicate Suffix

Putting `?` at the end of a symbol is a naming convention common across
many languages that support special characters in their symbol names. It is
used to indicate that the thing is a predicate, i.e. that it _poses a question_.
For example, imagine using an API that dealt with buffer manipulation:
[source,clojure]
----
(def my-buffer (buffers/create-buffer [1 2 3]))
(buffers/empty my-buffer)
----
At a glance, how would you know if the function `empty` in this case,

* Returned `true` if the passed in buffer was empty, or,
* Cleared the buffer

While the author could have renamed `empty` to `is-empty`, the richness of
symbol naming in Clojure allows us to express intent more symbolically.
[source,clojure]
----
(def my-buffer (buffers/create-buffer [1 2 3]))
(buffers/empty? my-buffer)
false
----
This is simply a recommended convention, not a requirement.

== `<symbol>!` - Unsafe Operations

https://github.com/bbatsov/clojure-style-guide#changing-state-fns-with-exclamation-mark[The Clojure style guide has this to say]:

====
The names of functions/macros that are not safe in STM transactions
should end with an exclamation mark (e.g `reset!`).
====
You'll most commonly see this appended to function names whose purpose
is to mutate state, e.g. connecting to a data store, updating an atom or
closing a file stream
[source,clojure]
----
user=> (def my-stateful-thing (atom 0))
#'user/my-stateful-thing
user=> (swap! my-stateful-thing inc)
1
user=> @my-stateful-thing
1
----

This is simply a recommended convention and not a requirement.

Note that the exclamation mark is often pronounced as bang.

== `_` - Unused argument

When you see the underscore character used as function arguments or in a `let` binding,
`pass:[_]` is a common naming convention to indicate you won't be using this argument.

This is an example using the `add-watch` function that can be used to add
callback style behaviour when atoms change value. Imagine, given an atom, we
want to print the new value every time it changes:

[source,clojure]
----
(def value (atom 0))

(add-watch value nil (fn [_ _ _ new-value]
                       (println new-value))

(reset! value 6)
; prints 6
(reset! value 9)
; prints 9
----

`add-watch` takes four arguments, but in our case we only really care about the
last argument - the new value of the atom so we use `_` for the others.

== `,` - Whitespace character

In Clojure, `,` is treated as whitespace, exactly the same as spaces, tabs, or newlines.
Commas are thus never required in literal collections, but are often used to enhance
readability:

[source,clojure]
----
user=>(def m {:a 1, :b 2, :c 3}
{:a 1, :b 2, :c 3}
----

== `#=` Reader eval

`#=` allows the reader to evaluate an arbitrary form during read time:

[source,clojure]
----
user=> (read-string "#=(+ 3 4)")
;;=> 7
----

Note that the read-time evaluation can also cause side-effects:
[source,clojure]
----
user=> (read-string "#=(println :foo)")
:foo
nil
----
Consequently, `read-string` is not safe to call with unverified user input.
For a safe alternative, see https://clojure.github.io/clojure/clojure.edn-api.html#clojure.edn/read-string[`clojure.edn/read-string`].

Note that `#=` is not an officially supported feature of the reader, so you
shouldn't rely on its presence in future versions of Clojure.

Many thanks to everyone who has contributed ideas and [the copious amounts of]
spelling corrections (crikey I'm bad at speelingz - so thanks Michael R. Mayne,
lobsang_ludd). I've tried to call out people who have specifically asked for
things. Sorry if I've missed you.
