Welcome to the Clojure Deref! This is a periodic link/news roundup for the Clojure ecosystem. (https://clojure.org/feed.xml[RSS feed])

## Highlights

This week https://www.reuters.com/article/us-nubank-funding-berkshire-idUSKCN2DK1FI[Nubank announced] a new $750M investment, led by $500M from Berkshire Hathaway at a $30B valuation. Nubank is the largest user of Clojure and Datomic in the world and a great example of the benefits of Clojure's approach to managing complexity at scale.

Chris Nuernberger https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5mUGu4RlwKE[presented a great talk] this week for London Clojurians about his work on high performance data processing with the https://github.com/cnuernber/dtype-next[dtype-next] and https://github.com/techascent/tech.ml.dataset[tech.ml.dataset] libraries.

The https://clojured.de/[ClojureD conference] last weekend was great with lots of interesting Clojure (and some non-Clojure) talks! Keep an eye out for videos soon.

Is it about woodworking? Is it about Clojure? Is it about how to work? Yes.
