Welcome to the Clojure Deref! This is a weekly link/news roundup for the Clojure ecosystem. (https://twitter.com/ClojureDeref[@ClojureDeref] https://clojure.org/feed.xml[RSS])

## Highlights

It is common to see complaints that both Clojure jobs and Clojure developers are hard to find. The real truth is: both exist, but there is sometimes a mismatch in either experience or geographic distribution. We don't typically highlight jobs in the Deref but here are some great places to find Clojure jobs:

* https://jobs.braveclojure.com/[Brave Clojure] - job board
* https://functional.works-hub.com/functional-programming-jobs[Functional Works] - job board
* http://clojurians.net[Clojurians slack] - #jobs and #remote-jobs channel
* https://clojureverse.org/c/community-center/jobs/52[Clojureverse]
* https://www.reddit.com/r/Clojure/comments/npeien/who_is_hiring_may_31_2021/[Clojure subreddit] - monthly thread
* https://kennytilton.github.io/whoishiring/[Who is hiring] - search at HackerNews
* https://twitter.com/search?q=clojure%20job&src=spelling_expansion_revert_click&f=live[Twitter search]

Also, I want to highlight that https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLaSn8eiZ631nON7le-wdZxTR0c5bxqPYi[clojureD 2021 conference] videos are coming out now, about one per day, check them out!

## Throwback Friday (I know, I'm doing it wrong)

In this recurring segment, we harken back to talks from an older time of yore. This week, we're featuring:

* https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPK6t7echuA[How to Think about Parallel Programming: Not!] by Guy L. Steele Jr from Strange Loop 2010 - it's a decade+ old but still worth watching for how we think about what languages should provide, and a particular inspiration to the later design of Clojure reducers
* https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lU3awBr5C7E[Advent of Code 2020, Day 17] by Zach Tellman - a wonderful example of how to work in Clojure. write code in your editor, eval small exprs to your REPL, building iteratively up to a final solution
