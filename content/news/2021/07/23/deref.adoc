Welcome to the Clojure Deref! This is a weekly link/news roundup for the Clojure ecosystem. (https://twitter.com/ClojureDeref[@ClojureDeref] https://clojure.org/feed.xml[RSS])

## Highlights

I started the week by writing a http://blog.fogus.me/2021/07/20/clojure-builds-as-an-amalgamation-of-orthogonal-parts/[post about the new Clojure library tools.build] and how to add support for building artifacts using this new tool in our collective Clojure utility belt. The discussion is framed around moving from a small Leiningen project.clj file to a build.clj that uses tools.build and the Clojure CLI to do its thing.

## Video throwback

Rich Hickey's 2016 Clojure/conj keynote entitled https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyLBGkS5ICk[Spec-ulation] is a deep discussion on growth versus breakage in software and well worth another look.
