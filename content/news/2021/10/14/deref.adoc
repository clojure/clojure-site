== Art

Once again, some really nice work from Jack Rusher - https://twitter.com/jackrusher/status/1447950443137613828[this tweet] highlights a nice function and the Clojure code that made it, and [this tweet](https://twitter.com/jackrusher/status/1447879286262743040) credit's https://thi.ng[Karsten Schmidt's] excellent thi.ng geom libraries! We are fortunate to have such great tools to work with in Clojure.
