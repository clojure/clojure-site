Welcome to the Clojure Deref! This is a weekly link/news roundup for the Clojure ecosystem. (https://twitter.com/ClojureDeref[@ClojureDeref] https://clojure.org/feed.xml[RSS])

== Highlights

Looks like https://www.reclojure.org/[re:Clojure] on Dec 3-4 is shaping up to be a great online event! Keynotes will be Gerald Sussman and Stephen Wolfram and other speakers being announced, so keep that on your calendar!

== In the core

Have you ever worked on one thing that highlighted another problem, and then you started working on that, and then that highlighted another problem? Well, it was that kind of week. I'm not ready to talk about all that stuff yet, maybe next week.

In our overall ticket https://clojure.org/dev/workflow[workflow], "vetting" is the step where Rich agrees something is worth working on, "release assignment" is where we decide something is in scope for the current release, and "screening" is where someone on the core team (usually me or Fogus, occasionally others) believes a patch is ready for Rich's final review. We've been trying to surface a list of new tickets for Rich to vet about once a month, and that's pulled from what we are seeing out in the community, looking at votes on ask.clojure, and our own sense of what's important.

One ticket that Rich reviewed and ok'ed from the https://clojure.atlassian.net/issues/?filter=10010[Screened] list this week was https://clojure.atlassian.net/browse/CLJ-2065[CLJ-2065] "reduce-kv fails on subvec", an old and annoying issue. Feel free to look at these various queues to see what's in process, but keep in mind that things move both forward AND backward through these queues based on review!
