Welcome to the Clojure Deref! This is a weekly link/news roundup for the Clojure ecosystem. (https://twitter.com/ClojureDeref[@ClojureDeref] https://clojure.org/feed.xml[RSS])

== Highlights

In Clojure-related business news, https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20220119005830/en/Fifth-Third-Announces-Acquisition-of-Dividend-Finance[Dividend Finance] is being acquired by Fifth Third. Also, there was a https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/20/south-koreas-agtech-startup-greenlabs-raises-140m-series-c-to-accelerate-global-expansion/[round of funding for Green Labs]. Both are users of Clojure, congrats to all!

== From the core

Last week we did a https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vmTKoPzJUo[roundup of jiras in Clojure 1.11.0-alpha4] and I was surprised that so many people actually watched it, so thanks for the feedback and interest. We'll try to do a bit more of that kind of thing in the future. Since the alpha4 release we've been working several things that came out of the release and a few of those changes have started to hit master this week:

* https://clojure.atlassian.net/browse/CLJ-2685[CLJ-2685] - fix to the generative tests for `iteration` which were occaasionally failing
* https://clojure.atlassian.net/browse/CLJ-2689[CLJ-2689] - fix to the clojure.math tests to make them less strict so they pass on M1 builds (java.lang.Math methods mostly allow differences of ~1 ulp "unit in last place")
* https://clojure.atlassian.net/browse/CLJ-2690[CLJ-2690] - updated the docstring and some arg names for http://clojure.github.io/clojure/branch-master/clojure.core-api.html#clojure.core/iteration[iteration]

No new release yet but I expect the next one will be 1.11.0-beta1. Big thanks to everyone who tried alpha4 and gave feedback.
