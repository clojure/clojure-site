Welcome to the Clojure Deref! This is a weekly link/news roundup for the Clojure ecosystem. (https://twitter.com/ClojureDeref[@ClojureDeref] https://clojure.org/feed.xml[RSS])

== Highlights

The https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/clojure2022[State of Clojure 2022 Survey] is closing today, so if you haven't filled it out yet, please do. We have some new questions this year and I think we'll get some interesting feedback, but only if you complete it!

This week we added https://github.com/sponsors/behrica[Carsten Behring] to the Nubank/Cognitect sponsorship rolls - Carsten has been working on scicloj.ml and clj-py-r-template most lately, so consider sponsorship if you're using those!

Also, a big congrats to Clojure users Ardoq[https://www.ardoq.com/] on their https://techcrunch.com/2022/03/09/ardoq-125m-enterprise-architecture/[$125M financing round]!
