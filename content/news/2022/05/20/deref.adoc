== Highlights

ClojureScript had a https://clojurescript.org/news/2022-05-13-release[major release] this week, now version 1.11.54, which updates ClojureScript to match parity with Clojure 1.11 support (new math namespace and other new functions, etc), and also resolves a long-standing issue with how ClojureScript vendored dependencies that could cause dependency conflicts.
