Welcome to the Clojure Deref! This is a weekly link/news roundup for the Clojure ecosystem. (https://twitter.com/ClojureDeref[@ClojureDeref] https://clojure.org/feed.xml[RSS])

== Highlights

So many cool things happening this week in the Clojure Deref! I would encourage you to dive into some of the links below in every section - there are really interesting podcasts, videos, blogs, articles, and new libraries this week and I feel like repeating them all here just takes time away from you looking below, so do that!

I will mention the Clojurists Together https://www.clojuriststogether.org/news/q3-2022-funding-announcement/[Q3 2022 Funding Announcement] though - it so cool to see the community collectively funding such a wide variety of projects. Many thanks to all the project developers doing the work, the community supporting them, and Clojurists Together for being the glue that brings them all together.
