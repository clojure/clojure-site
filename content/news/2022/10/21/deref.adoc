Welcome to the Clojure Deref! This is a weekly link/news roundup for the Clojure ecosystem. (https://twitter.com/ClojureDeref[@ClojureDeref] https://clojure.org/feed.xml[RSS])

== Highlights

Happy 15th birthday to Clojure! Some of us on the core team got together last weekend to celebrate. There was cake, it was good. Thank you for using Clojure and being part of the community. 

Also see this https://building.nubank.com.br/clojure-15th-anniversary-a-retrospective/[retrospective] post from Nubank and https://nubank.zoom.us/webinar/register/WN_oRfGy8f7S2q5gV9WBq4wQQ[join us next week] for a panel discussion with Rich, Stu, Fogus, and me! It will be recorded so you can catch it afterwards too.
