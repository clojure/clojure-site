Welcome to the Clojure Deref! This is a weekly link/news roundup for the Clojure ecosystem. (https://twitter.com/ClojureDeref[@ClojureDeref] https://clojure.org/feed.xml[RSS])

== Clojure/conj 2023

https://2023.clojure-conj.org/[Clojure/conj] is the oldest gathering of the Clojure community and the next edition will be April 27-28, 2023 in Durham, NC. This is a great place to learn about the most interesting developments in the Clojure ecosystem and talk to a wide range of Clojure users. Additionally, for the first time this year we will have streaming access so the broader community can participate even if they are not able to attend in person. Rich Hickey, the creator of Clojure, will present a talk as well. https://2023.clojure-conj.org/tickets/[Register now for early bird or streaming tickets!]

The https://2023.clojure-conj.org/call-for-proposals/[Call for Proposals] is open NOW until January 15th! We invite members of the community to submit proposals for talks that explore the latest trends and techniques in the world of Clojure or Clojure-adjacent technologies. Speakers receive a free ticket, travel, and hotel.

The https://2023.clojure-conj.org/call-for-proposals/[Sponsorship Prospectus] is also available - if you're looking to hire or connect to Clojure developers, this is for you! Thanks for supporting the conference and the Clojure community.
