Welcome to the Clojure Deref! This is a weekly link/news roundup for the Clojure ecosystem (feed: https://clojure.org/feed.xml[RSS]). Thanks to Anton Fonarev for link aggregation.

== From the core

BIG NEWS: https://clojure.org/news/2024/09/05/clojure-1-12-0[Clojure 1.12] is now available! Please do take a look at the release notes - we are excited to bring you all of these improvements and looking forward to what's next! Two things we have already started on are integrating Java virtual threads into core.async and updating the baseline JVM version for the next version of Clojure. More to come in the future I'm sure.

If you want to get the latest updates on Clojure and Datomic, you should definitely check out two upcoming events - https://2024.heartofclojure.eu/[Heart of Clojure] Sept 18-19 in Leuven, Belgium and https://2024.clojure-conj.org[Clojure/conj] Oct 23-25 in Alexandria, Virginia. These will both be great events and a special opportunity to connect and learn from other Clojurists in Europe and the US.
