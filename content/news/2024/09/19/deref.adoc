Welcome to the Clojure Deref! This is a weekly link/news roundup for the Clojure ecosystem (feed: https://clojure.org/feed.xml[RSS]). Thanks to Anton Fonarev for link aggregation.

== From the core

Hey, it's that time again - PLEASE fill out the https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/clojure2024[2024 State of Clojure survey]. Most questions are optional, feel free to skip the ones that don't apply.

Watching from afar, it looks like https://2024.heartofclojure.eu/[Heart of Clojure] was a rousing success as expected! I was sorry to miss it. If you missed it, the https://2024.clojure-conj.org[Clojure/conj] is coming up soon though Oct 23-25. Get your tickets now and let's have a great time!
