https://github.com/clojure/core.async[core.async] 1.9.808-alpha1 is now available, featuring the first release of **core.async.flow**. You can read more about core.async.flow in https://clojure.github.io/core.async/flow.html[the rationale] and https://clojure.github.io/core.async/clojure.core.async.flow.html[the docs].

core.async.flow is in alpha state - all APIs are still subject to change but we welcome your feedback as we move towards a non-alpha release.

This release also adds datafy support for channels and buffers.

== core.async.flow-monitor

In addition, we are today releasing https://github.com/clojure/core.async.flow-monitor/[core.async.flow-monitor] v0.1.0, which is a tool for visualizing a flow's processes as SVG (viewable inline in Calva or Cursive!), and dynamically monitoring and interacting with flows as they are running.
