It's time for the annual State of Clojure Survey!

If you use Clojure, ClojureScript, Babashka, or any other Clojure dialect, we would love to get your responses to the following survey:

* https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/clojure2025[State of Clojure 2025]

Most questions are not required, so please skip any questions that are not applicable.

The survey will close at the end of the year (December 31st), after which we will release the data with some analysis. We greatly appreciate your input!
