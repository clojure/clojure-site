Welcome to the Clojure Deref! This is a weekly link/news roundup for the Clojure ecosystem (feed: https://clojure.org/feed.xml[RSS]).


== The annual Clojure surveys are live

Help shape the future of Clojure!

Whether you use Clojure, ClojureScript, Babashka, or any other Clojure dialect,
please fill out the https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/clojure2025[2025 State of
Clojure Survey] and spread the word on social media.

This survey gives us the best snapshot of the Clojure community, so help us get as many participants as possible.

If you use ClojureScript or dialects like Squint, Cherry, nbb, and such, please
fill out the https://state-of-clojurescript.com/[2025 State of ClojureScript
Survey] and share it with others.

Thank you for your help!
