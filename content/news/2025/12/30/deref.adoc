Welcome to the Clojure Deref! This is a weekly link/news roundup for the Clojure ecosystem (feed: https://clojure.org/feed.xml[RSS]).


== Last chance for the annual Clojure surveys!

Time is running out to take the Clojure surveys! Please help spread the
word, and take a moment to fill them out if you haven't already.

Fill out the https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/clojure2025[2025 State of Clojure
Survey] if you use any version or dialect of Clojure in any capacity.

Fill out the https://state-of-clojurescript.com/[2025 State of ClojureScript
Survey] and if you use ClojureScript or dialects like Squint, Cherry, nbb, and
such.

Thank you for your help!
