Clojure provides for code loading and dependency tracking via its "lib" facility. A lib is a named unit of Clojure source code contained in a Java resource within classpath. A lib will typically provide the complete set of definitions that make up one Clojure namespace.

== Lib Conventions

Clojure defines conventions for naming and structuring libs:

* A lib name is a symbol that will typically contain two or more parts separated by periods.
* A lib's container is a Java resource whose classpath-relative path is derived from the lib name:
** The path is a string
** Periods in the lib name are replaced by slashes in the path
** Hyphens in the lib name are replaced by underscores in the path
** The path ends with ".clj"
* A lib begins with an "ns" form that
** creates the Clojure namespace that shares its name, and
** declares its dependencies on Java classes, Clojure's core facilities, and/or other libs,

Clojure ensures that if the call to "ns" completes without throwing an exception, the declared dependencies have been satisfied and the capabilities they provide are available.

== Example Lib

A simple lib with embedded explanations:

[source,clojure]
----
(ns com.my-company.clojure.examples.my-utils
  (:import java.util.Date)
  (:use [clojure.contrib.def :only (defvar-)])
  (:require [clojure.contrib.shell-out :as shell]))
----

* The `ns` form names the lib's namespace and declares its dependencies. Based on its name, this lib must be contained in a Java resource at the classpath-relative path: com/my_company/clojure/examples/my_utils.clj (note the translations from period to slash and hyphen to underscore).
* The `:import` clause declares this lib's use of `java.util.Date` and makes it available to code in this lib using its unqualified name.
* The `:use` clause declares a dependency on the `clojure.contrib.def` lib for its `defvar-` function only. +defvar-+ may be used in this lib's code using its unqualified name.
* The `:require` clause declares a dependency on the `clojure.contrib.shell-out` lib and enables using its members using the shorter namespace alias `shell+.
+
[source,clojure]
----
(defvar- greetings
  {:english "Hello"
   :german "Guten Tag"
   :french "Bonjour"}
  "Map from language to greeting")
----
* `defvar-` used without namespace qualification
+
[source,clojure]
----
(defn- user-prop
  "Returns the system property for user.<key>"
  [key]
  (System/getProperty (str "user." key)))

(defn greeting
  "Returns a greeting for the current user. The greeting is in English by
  default, or optionally in another language: :german or :french"
  ([]
     (greeting :english))
  ([language]
     (str (greetings language) " " (user-prop "name"))))

(defn user-files
  "Returns a seq of the file names in the current user's home directory"
  []
  (seq (.split (shell/sh "ls" (user-prop "home")) "\n")))
----
* `sh` from `clojure.contrib.shell-out` used via the `shell` namespace alias
+
[source,clojure]
----
(defn print-report
  "Prints a report containing some info about the current user"
  []
  (println (greeting))
  (println "These are some of your files as of" (str (Date.)))
  (doseq [file (take 10 (user-files))]
    (println file)))
----

== Prefix Lists

It's common for a lib to depend on several other libs whose full names share a common prefix. In calls to `require` and `use` (and in `:require` and `:use` clauses within an +ns+ form), the common prefix can be extracted and provided once using a prefix list. For example, these two forms are equivalent:

[source,clojure]
----
(require 'clojure.contrib.def 'clojure.contrib.except 'clojure.contrib.sql)
(require '(clojure.contrib def except sql))
----
