=== 1.10.0-beta6 (Nov 16, 2018)

Changes in 1.10.0-beta6:

* The metadata protocol extension added in 1.10.0-beta5 now requires opt-in when the protocol is defined, using :extend-via-metadata.
* The JavaReflector under clojure.reflect has been datafied
* https://clojure.atlassian.net/browse/CLJ-2432[CLJ-2432] - Added clojure.core/requiring-resolve which is like `resolve` but will `require` the symbol's namespace if needed.

=== 1.10.0-alpha5 (June 27, 2018)

Clojure 1.10.0-alpha5 is now available.

1.10.0-alpha5 includes the following changes since 1.10.0-alpha4:

* https://clojure.atlassian.net/browse/CLJ-2363[CLJ-2363] - make Java 8 the minimum requirement for Clojure (also bumps embedded ASM to latest) - thanks Ghadi Shayban!
* https://clojure.atlassian.net/browse/CLJ-2284[CLJ-2284] - fix invalid bytecode generation for static interface method calls in Java 9+ - thanks Ghadi Shayban!

NOTE: 1.10.0-alpha5 drops support for Java 6 and 7 and makes Java 8 the minimum requirement. Compilation will produce Java 8 level bytecode (which will not run on earlier versions of Java). This is the first change in bytecode version since Clojure 1.6. We would greatly appreciate it if you tried this release with your library or project and provided feedback about errors, performance differences (good or bad), compatibility, etc.

When using the `clj` tool and deps.edn, we recommend adding an alias to your ~/.clojure/deps.edn:

[source,clojure]
----
{:aliases
 {:clj/next
  {:override-deps
   {org.clojure/clojure {:mvn/version "1.10.0-alpha5"}}}}}
----

You can then run any of your projects with the latest Clojure dev release by activating the alias with `clj`: 

[source,shell]
----
clj -A:clj/next
----

=== https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/clojure/nB4qnDNGS2A[1.9.0-alpha16] (Apr 27, 2017)

1.9.0-alpha16 includes the following changes since 1.9.0-alpha15:

- The namespaces clojure.spec, clojure.spec.gen, clojure.spec.test have been moved to the external library spec.alpha which Clojure includes via dependency
- These namespaces have been changed and now have an appended ".alpha": clojure.spec.alpha, clojure.spec.gen.alpha, clojure.spec.test.alpha
- All keyword constants in clojure.spec (like :clojure.spec/invalid) follow the same namespace change (now :clojure.spec.alpha/invalid)
- spec-related system properties related to assertions did NOT change

- The specs for clojure.core itself in namespace clojure.core.specs have been moved to the external library core.specs.alpha which Clojure now depends on
- The clojure.core.specs namespace has changed to clojure.core.specs.alpha. All qualified spec names in that namespace follow the same namespace change (most people were not using these directly)

In most cases, you should be able to update your usage of Clojure 1.9.0-alphaX to Clojure 1.9.0-alpha16 by:

1. Updating your Clojure dependency to [org.clojure/clojure "1.9.0-alpha16"]  - this will automatically pull in the 2 additional downstream libraries
2. Changing your namespace declarations in namespaces that declare or use specs to:

[source,clojure]
----
(:require [clojure.spec.alpha :as s]
          [clojure.spec.gen.alpha :as gen]
          [clojure.spec.test.alpha :as stest])
----

=== https://groups.google.com/d/msg/clojure/10dbF7w2IQo/ec37TzP5AQAJ[1.9/spec split] (Apr 26, 2017)

We are moving spec out of the Clojure repo/artifact and into a library to make it easier to evolve spec independently from Clojure. While we consider spec to be an essential part of Clojure 1.9, there are a number of design concerns to resolve before it can be finalized. This allows us to move towards a production Clojure release (1.9) that depends on an alpha version of spec. Users can also pick up newer versions of the spec alpha library as desired. Additionally, this is a first step towards increased support for leveraging dependencies within Clojure.

We will be creating two new contrib libraries that will contain the following (renamed) namespaces:

----
org.clojure/spec.alpha
    clojure.spec.alpha          (previously clojure.spec)
    clojure.spec.gen.alpha      (previously clojure.spec.gen)
    clojure.spec.test.alpha     (previously clojure.spec.test)

org.clojure/core.specs.alpha
    clojure.core.specs.alpha    (previously clojure.core.specs)
----

In most cases, we expect that users have aliased their reference to the spec namespaces and updating to the changed namespaces will only require a single change at the point of the require.

*How will ClojureScript's spec implementation change?*

ClojureScript will also change namespace names to match Clojure. Eventually, the ClojureScript implementation may move out of ClojureScript and into the spec.alpha library - this is still under discussion.

*Why do the libraries and namespaces end in alpha?*

The "alpha" indicates that the spec API and implementation is still subject to change.

*What will happen when the spec api is no longer considered alpha?*

At that point we expect to release a non-alpha version of the spec library (with non-alpha namespaces). Users may immediately begin to use that version of spec along with whatever version of Clojure it depends on. Clojure itself will depend on it at some later point. Timing of all these actions is TBD.

*Will the library support Clojure 1.8 or older versions?*

No. spec uses new functions in Clojure 1.9 and it has never been a goal to provide spec for older versions. Rather, we are trying to accelerate the release of a stable Clojure 1.9 so that users can migrate forward to a stable production release with access to an alpha version of spec, and access to ongoing updated versions as they become available.

- s/conform of nilable was always returning the passed value, not the conformed value
- s/nilable now creates a generator that returns nil 10% of the time (instead of 50% of the time)

1.9.0-alpha11 includes the following changes since 1.9.0-alpha10:

Clojure now has specs for the following clojure.core macros: let, if-let, when-let, defn, defn-, fn, and ns. Because macro specs are checked during macroexpansion invalid syntax in these macros will now fail at compile time whereas some errors were caught at runtime and some were not caught at all.

- https://clojure.atlassian.net/browse/CLJ-1914[CLJ-1914] - Fixed race condition in concurrent range realization
- https://clojure.atlassian.net/browse/CLJ-1870[CLJ-1870] - Fixed reloading a defmulti removes metadata on the var

- https://clojure.atlassian.net/browse/CLJ-1993[CLJ-1993] - Added `pass:[*print-namespace-maps*]` dynamic var that controls whether to use namespace map syntax for maps with keys from the same namespace. The default is false, but standard REPL bindings set this to true.
- https://clojure.atlassian.net/browse/CLJ-1985[CLJ-1985] - Fixed with-gen of conformer losing unform fn
- Fixed clojure.spec.test/check to skip spec'ed macros

- NEW clojure.core/any? - a predicate that matches anything. any? has built-in gen support. The :clojure.spec/any spec has been removed. Additionally, gen support has been added for some?.

- keys* will now gen

- gen overrides (see c.s/gen, c.s./exercise, c.s.t/check, c.s.t/instrument) now expect no-arg functions that return gens, rather than gens

- clojure.spec/merge - now merges rather than flows in conform/unform

- clojure.spec.test/instrument now reports the caller that caused an :args spec failure and ignores spec'ed macros

- clojure.spec.test - `test`, `test-fn`, `testable-syms` renamed to `check`, `check-fn`, and `checkable-syms` to better reflect their purpose. Additionally, some of the return value structure of `check` has been further improved.

- clojure.core/Throwable->map formerly returned StackTraceElements which were later handled by the printer. Now the StackTraceElements are converted to data such that the return value is pure Clojure data, as intended.

1.9.0-alpha8 includes the following changes since 1.9.0-alpha7:

The collection spec support has been greatly enhanced, with new controls for conforming, generation, counts, distinct elements and collection kinds. See the docs for every, every-kv, coll-of and map-of for details.

instrumenting and testing has been streamlined and made more composable, with powerful new features for spec and gen overrides, stubbing, and mocking. See the docs for these functions in clojure.spec.test: instrument, test, enumerate-ns and summarize-results.

Namespaced keyword reader format, printing and destructuring have been enhanced for lifting namespaces up for keys, supporting more succinct use of fully-qualified keywords. Updated docs will be added to clojure.org soon.

Many utilities have been added, for keys spec merging, fn exercising, Java 1.8 timestamps, bounded-count and more.

Changelog:

clojure.spec:
